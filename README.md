With the increase in the number of internet users, there is a deluge of 
traffic over the web, handling Internet traffic with much more 
optimized and efficient approach is the need of the hour. In this project, 
I have tried to forecast Internet traffic on TCP/IP network using web 
traffic data of Wikipedia articles, provided by Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tommyngx/web-traffic/data). I work 
on the stationarity of time series and use mathematical concepts of log 
transformation, differencing and decomposition in order to make the 
time series stationary. This research presents an approach for 
forecasting web traffic for these articles using the statistical time series 
model Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model. 
This research work opens the possibility of efficient traffic handling 
thus, leading to improved performance for an organization as well as 
better experience for the users on the internet. Forecasting the network 
traffic and displaying it in a dashboard that updates in real-time would 
be the most efficient way to convey the information. Creating a 
Dashboard would help in monitoring and analysing real-time data. In 
this day and age, we are too dependent on Google server but if we want 
to host a server for large users we could have predicted the number of 
users from previous years to avoid server breakdown. Time Series 
forecasting is crucial to multiple domains.
